## Measurement Data

With our large-scale testing infrastructure and in-situ failure scene capturing method, we conduct a long-term study regarding the real-world performance of mobile app testing on virtualized devices from Jan. 1 to Mar. 31 in 2022.
All the study and analysis involved in our study were conducted under a well-established IRB, and no personally identifiable information (e.g., phone number, IMEI, and IMSI) was collected throughout the study.

This directory contains the failure event data that we collected with proper anonymization.

## Data Format

The attributes of each failure event are organized as follows:

|  Attribute   | Description  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| error  | The triggered exception/signal of the failure. |
| scene  | A brief summary of the anonymized failure scene. |
| os_version  | The Android version of the device producing the failure. |
| device_brand  | The brand of the device producing the failure. |
| device_model  | The model of the device producing the failure. |
| device_type  | The type of the device. Specifically, `physical` denotes a physical device and `virtualized` denotes a virtualized device. |
| failure_layer  | The layer in which the failure occurred. Specifically, `java` and `native` denote that the failure occurred in the Java or the native layer, respectively. |
