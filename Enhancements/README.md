# Our Enhancements

## Introduction

In order to effectively enhance the testing fidelity on virtualized devices, we have built on our insights to address various discrepancies under cross-boundary and conflict-of-interest scenarios. 
More importantly, we have devised practical and strategical mechanisms to coordinate multiple crucial stakeholders in the mobile industry, in particular to convince them of the effectiveness of our solutions. 
With these efforts, we manage to eliminate most of the discrepancies in reality.

## Code Organization

This directory contains the source code for the three enhancements we make in the paper, with each folder corresponding to one enhancement. 
Apart from source code release, we have also provided a detailed `README.md` document for each enhancement.

## Code Portability

All the modifications to AOSP involved in our enhancements are based on the `android10-release` branch, since, at the time of our study, Android 10 is the most prevalent version among the users of T-video.
The related logic in other Android versions stay largely unchanged, and therefore you can easily port the enhancements to any recent Android version that you desire.
