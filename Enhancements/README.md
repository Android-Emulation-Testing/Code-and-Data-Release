# Enhancements

In order to effectively enhance the testing fidelity on virtualized devices, we have built on our insights to address the 10 various discrepancies under cross-boundary and conflict-of-interest scenarios. 
More importantly, we have devised practical and strategical mechanisms to coordinate multiple crucial stakeholders in the mobile industry, in particular to convince them of the effectiveness of our solutions. 
With these efforts, we manage to eliminate most of the discrepancies in reality.

This directory contains the source code for the three enhancements we make in the paper.
The three folders correspond to the enhancements. For each enhancement, we have provided our source code along with a detailed README.md document.
