# Code and Data Release

This repo contains the code and data involved in our study.

## Code Release

### Failure Scene Capture

We have provided the source code of captureing failure scene mentioned in our paper in the [`capture` folder](https://github.com/Android-Emulation-Testing/code-and-data/tree/main/capture).
### Enhancements

We have provided the source code of the enhancements mentioned in our paper in the [`enhancements` folder](https://github.com/Android-Emulation-Testing/code-and-data/tree/main/enhancements).

## Data Release

We have provided in part the measurement data (with proper anonymization) in the [`data` folder](https://github.com/Android-Emulation-Testing/code-and-data/tree/main/data). 
We will release the full dataset as soon as we obtain official approval of the relevant authorities.
